# [[MODEL]_DEFAULT] are default value present at startup.
# You can directly edit default profile or make your own.
# Keep address_[n] according to your model, unless you know what you are doing.
# Use base16 for address and base10 for temp(Â°C) or fan_speed(%).
#
# cpu fan will spin at cpu_fan_speed_0:
# 		if realtime_cpu_temp is above cpu_temp_0
#			cpu_fan_speed_1 is applied
# 		if realtime_cpu_temp is above cpu_temp_1
#			cpu_fan_speed_2 is applied
#		[...]
#
# Some fan_speed value are ignored by laptops, they will trigger the closest valid RPM speed, isw can't see it.
# You can find a better explanation of how ec work at:
# https://github.com/YoyPa/isw/wiki/How-EC-work-(for-GS40-6QE-at-least)
# You can help me support your laptop (mainly MSI) by openning an issue and providing 'isw -c' output.
