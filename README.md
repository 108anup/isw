# ISW / Ice-Sealed Wyvern

## Warning
- isw was made/tested with MSI GS40 6QE, please verify that your EC (Embedded Controler) work the same way before trying.
- You can find documentation on the wiki: https://github.com/YoyPa/isw/wiki/How-EC-work-(for-GS40-6QE-at-least)
- isw is only tested under Arch/Manjaro (systemd).
- Use it at your own risk !

## Purpose
isw was made as an equivalent of "control tools by pherein" but under linux.

### In details
- Replace <b>temp</b> at <b>address</b>,<b>address</b>+1,...,<b>address</b>+5.
- <b>address</b> are in hex
- <b>temp</b> are in Â°C.
- EC contain 7 <b>temp</b>, 6 of them will be edited, last one is left at 0x64(100).
- Profiles for supported laptops are located in <b>/etc/isw.conf</b>.

## How to use it ?
- It need ```ec_sys``` module with option ```write_support=1```, there are to scenario to set that:
  - 1.1 ec_sys is a builtin module, add ```ec_sys.write_support=1``` in ```/etc/default/grub``` (Arch AUR package can't do it for you).
  - 1.2 then update your grub and reboot.
  - 2.1 ec_sys is not a builtin module, copy both ```isw-ec_sys.conf``` files provided (/etc/foo) with same path (Arch AUR package will do it for you).
  - 2.2 then reboot OR ```modprobe ec_sys write_support=1```.
- Use option ```-c``` to read EC OR/AND ```-w [PROFILE_NAME]``` to write in EC.
- Option ```-c``` can be used alone or in conjuction with ```-w``` like ```-cw [foo]``` ```-w [foo] -c``` ```-cw [foo] -c``` to print EC before/after write or both.

NB: all option exept -h need priviledges.
